# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.7.0] - 2025-01-16

### Changed

- Upgraded to Flutter v3.28.3.

## [1.6.3] - 2025-01-15

### Changed

- Enhanced period logging accuracy. Now, when the first day of a period is logged, the app automatically logs the entire period duration (defaulting to 5 days) for that cycle. This replaces the previous method of logging only the first day and predicting the rest, which often led to inaccurate forecasts.
